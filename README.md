**The ultimate guide to engineering and deploying high-quality 
models based on good data**

## What is this book about?
In the rapidly advancing data-driven world where data quality is pivotal to the success of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects, this critically timed guide provides a rare, end-to-end overview of data-centric machine learning (DCML), along with hands-on applications of technical and non-technical approaches to generating deeper and more accurate datasets.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the impact of input data quality compared to model selection and tuning
* Recognize the crucial role of subject-matter experts in effective model development
* Implement data cleaning, labeling, and augmentation best practices
* Explore common synthetic data generation techniques and their applications
* Apply synthetic data generation techniques using common Python packages
* Detect and mitigate bias in a dataset using best-practice techniques
* Understand the importance of reliability, responsibility, and ethical considerations in ML/AI
